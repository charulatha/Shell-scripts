# Shell-scripts


What is Shell?
Shell is a UNIX term for an interface between a user and an operating system service. Shell provides users with an interface and accepts human-readable commands into the system and executes those commands which can run automatically and give the program’s output in a shell script.

An Operating is made of many components, but its two prime components are –
Kernel
Shell

A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input. When a program finishes executing, it displays that program's output.
Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs, and shell scripts. There are different flavours of a shell, just as there are different flavours of operating systems. Each flavour of shell has its own set of recognised commands and functions.

The prompt, $, which is called the command prompt, is issued by the shell. While the prompt is displayed, you can type a command.

Shell reads your input after you press Enter.

Following is a simple example of the date command, which displays the current date and time −


1)$date
2)ls
3)pwd
